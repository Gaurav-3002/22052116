# Error Resolution Log

## 2024-02-04

### Initial Errors:
1. Multiple declarations of API functions in `src/services/api.js`:
   - `getUsers` declared twice
   - `getUserPosts` declared twice
   - `getPostComments` declared twice

### Fixes Applied:
1. Combined mock and real API functions in `src/services/api.js`:
   - Added `USE_MOCK_DATA` flag to switch between mock and real API
   - Merged mock data functions with real API functions
   - Each function now checks `USE_MOCK_DATA` flag before deciding which implementation to use
   - Added proper error handling and caching for both implementations

### Current Status:
- [x] Fixed duplicate function declarations
- [x] Implemented proper error handling
- [x] Added caching mechanism
- [x] Maintained mock data for development
- [x] Feed component displays posts correctly
- [x] Dark theme applied correctly

### Remaining Tasks:
1. Test all API endpoints with both mock and real data
2. Add loading states for API calls
3. Implement error boundaries for better error handling
4. Add retry mechanism for failed API calls
5. Add proper TypeScript types for API responses

### Notes:
- Mock data is currently enabled by default (`USE_MOCK_DATA = true`)
- Cache duration is set to 5 seconds
- All API functions are now async and return Promises
